Most of us provides some sort services at the same time also consumes it. But have we given a thought what Service actually is? Let’s try to scratch a surface a little bit and explore its contribution as a sector and its important.

Service can mean a lot of different things to different people. For lawyers, service is the formal delivery of legal documents such as a summons. For homeowners, it can be a utility such as gas, electricity, or water. For car owners, it’s the annual maintenance of their vehicle. For caregivers, it may be in the form of taking care of their patients.

### What is a Service?

Service is an activity where more than two persons/entities are involved and one of them offer a value addition to others. 

According to Philip Kotler *“A service is an act of performance that one party can offer to another that is essentially intangible and does not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not be tied to a physical product.”*

For example, with computer software, a service is software that performs automated tasks, responds to hardware events, or listens for data requests from other software.

The three industries within the services division that experienced the most growth in the last decade have been business services, health care, and social services. The business services areas in which the largest number of jobs was gained were personnel supply and computer services. The computer services industry includes mass-produced software, custom programming, custom computer systems design, and computer leasing. The primary reason for growth in both of these areas has been changes in business processes.
