The computer is one of the greatest inventions of the last century. Imagine a world without a computer and computers without underlying software. Computers and software not only made our lives easier but helps us see beyond our imagination.

The history of software development, with the more and more progress, has covered a wide range of innovation indeed. Additional information on how to improve different systems, which can help business and other organizations, have surfaced. 

> Software and technology have moved from sector to sector, helping companies reimagine the speed, scale, and depth of how they operate.

Today, the programming language and operating systems only continue to be enhanced further.

Software development has been supported by different kinds of programming through the years. For example, object-oriented programming is a model that focuses on software design on data, or so-called objects, instead of functions and logic.  

On the other hand, structured programming—another term software engineering professional knows—is a model that makes use of structured control flow constructs of selection and repetition, among others, in developing computer programs and systems.

Even though the languages, such as [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), are relatively younger compared to others, they have become a staple in software development projects.

> The recent outbreak of COVID 19 around the world has forced everyone to rely on technology more than ever before. Every industry is going through major digital overhaul due to change in consumer behavior. Backed by strong software support, people are adopting to changes right from Work from Home (WFH) to Virtual Learning / E-learning to Contactless Services, E-commerce to digital payments.

## Making an impact with Software Services


## 2021 and Beyond

**Cybersecurity**

Due to the pandemic, data and device security became paramount while your team is working remotely. Since we have been witnessing increase in cyber attacks and innovative approach of attackers, traditional detection based security tools won't help much to safeguard against cyber threats including zero day attacks.

 - Cloud breaches
 - Ransomware Attacks
 - Preventing measures

 **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for quite some time but is still in trend due to its potential and various use cases. 
 - Computer Vision Applications
 - Predictive Analytics
 - Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) and automated speech recognition(ASR)

**Internet of Things (IoTs)** 

**Blockchains**

Decentralization makes the blockchain extremely safe and ideal for all sorts of online operations, money transfers, smart development, and so on. Blockchain is no more limited just to crypto-currencies and banking sector. We can see major adoptions of this technology in various industry such as Supply Chain Management, Insurance, Healthcare, Transportation and warehousing and Cybersecurity.

**Big Data Analytics**

**Progressive Web Applications**

**Java and JVM**

**Python**


With the ongoing disruptions in business operations, business owners are thinking ahead and outsourcing product development to trusted technology partners to free up their time, save cost, and drive efficiency.
