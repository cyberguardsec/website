The computer is one of the greatest inventions of the last century. Imagine a world without a computer and computers without underlying software. Computers and software not only made our lives easier but helps us see beyond our imagination.

The history of software development, with the more and more progress, has covered a wide range of innovation indeed. Additional information on how to improve different systems, which can help business and other organizations, have surfaced. 

> Software and technology have moved from sector to sector, helping companies reimagine the speed, scale, and depth of how they operate.

Today, the programming language and operating systems only continue to be enhanced further.

Software development has been supported by different kinds of programming through the years.

For example, object-oriented programming is a model that focuses on software design on data, or so-called objects, instead of functions and logic.  

On the other hand, structured programming—another term software engineering professional knows—is a model that makes use of structured control flow constructs of selection and repetition, among others, in developing computer programs and systems.

Even though the languages, such as [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), are relatively younger compared to others, they have become a staple in software development projects.

> The recent outbreak of COVID 19 around the world has forced everyone to rely on technology more ever than before. Right from Work from Home (WFH) to Virtual Learning / E-learning to contactless services, people are consuming software by any form.
