I grew up watching my father going to his office every day. In my childhood, I was fascinated by my father's work. He was a government employee and people used to call him "Saheb" and gave him a lot of respect. Sometimes he used to bring me with him to his office and then I felt I also wanted to work with the government as an employee and help people around me that give me respect, attention and a sense of pride. Those were the early days of my ideas about a job.  

Things changed when I got admitted to college. In the meantime, apart from the government, I learned that there are large numbers of opportunities available in private and public sector companies where people used to work with an equal amount of passion. We learned about campus placement and its importance to kick start our professional careers. Those were early days where everyone wanted to get selected in our desired companies(mostly in MNCs) without thinking much about other factors and with little to no expectation apart from salary. Some of us got selected in the campus placement and some got another opportunity to look for "Dream jobs" in the open market and prove their worth.

The real test began when we started working. At the beginning of the career, apart from primary skill sets and technical knowledge, we were learning a lot of other important aspects and one of them was about company culture. We were thinking whatever is happening around us, is the ideal company culture.

According to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), till this time basic needs were being met and they were no longer acting as a motivation. We were silently examining how our seniors and peers were treating us. We were now concerned about whether our opinion is valued in the team meeting and our work is appreciated. Are we getting help and support from our leaders and subordinates?

Now when I look back, I feel fortunate to have worked for companies who have better work-life balance, inclusive culture, motivational and supportive team members and a flat hierarchy where you can reach out to anyone.

>**Company culture is one of the important factors that play a vital role in shaping the future of both companies and employees.**

Time has changed a lot, so has the competition. The nature of the job market, especially in the IT sector, has changed from low-cost resources to a highly technical skill-oriented workforce. Major MNCs have their R&D centers in India. Nowadays companies are competing to attract the best talent available in the market and employees are looking for the best opportunity. Salary and job security are no longer the only motivational factors for employees to consider while joining a company. Similarly, companies are also looking more from candidates apart from stability and knowledge.


> **Company culture can be defined as the shared values, beliefs, or perceptions held by employees within an organization.**
  

### Important elements that shape Company Culture

**Leadership**

Leadership influences company culture heavily. Leaders define the direction of a company and can reinforce organisational values by helping their people grow and develop through goal setting, opportunities, and recognition. Elevate employees through frequent one-on-ones and regular two-way feedback. When employees have open and ongoing dialogue about their work, their trust in their leader strengthens.

**Community**

Employees often work for more than 8 hours a day and feel a deep and personal connection with the work and the company, and expect some appreciation from colleagues and managers. Celebrating special occasions and events such as birthdays, Annual day etc., career milestones and achievements are some of the factors that impact company culture.

**Trust & Caring**

Mutual trust builds a strong and long-lasting relationship between the company and employees. Policies such as unlimited paid vacations, offering financial help when needed and involvement of employees in critical decision making are some of the factors that make employees work more comfortably. On the other hand, companies also expect trustworthiness from employees.

**Fairness**

Fairness is a fundamental concern for employees, and if employees believe there is a lack of fairness, it can negatively affect their productivity, trust in management and personal well-being. On the other hand, if employees feel they are treated fairly they will be more willing to “create and take risks” which in turn leads to better business performance.

**Ethics**

Ethics are the set of values, moral principles, and standards that need to be followed by both employers and employees in the workplace. Employers should actively work to create a workplace environment that makes it possible for employees to take pride in their work and identify with the values that drive the company as a whole. In addition, the company should respect the rights and dignity of all employees.

**Innovation**

Employees feel more comfortable when they get a chance to showcase their talent or get a safe environment to express their ideas and make suggestions. In return, it helps in innovation for a company.
