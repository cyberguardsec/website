In my last blog I had discussed the company culture and the working environment at Cyberguard, here I discuss a few points about job applicants. I hope to help in guiding job applicants look for and land the right job. As the saying goes “the right candidate at the right place” is very important for an organization as well as for the candidate.

So before applying for any job there are few things that you have to keep in mind.

- All of us when we start searching for a job we use Naukri.com or linkedIn. These two sites are highly preferred in India. You can always keep your profiles on these two sites updated. That always gives a brief idea about yourself and your work experience.

- Before applying for any job one must go through the job description and the profile that the company is hiring for. Also always check the companies’ websites to get a clear idea about what the company does which will help you match your skills and align yours and the companies’ goals.

- Now the candidate's behaviour plays a very important role here. If you are applying on your own through any above-mentioned website for any position just mention it while dropping an email to the HR matching what is mentioned in the job post. Also add a few points about yourself and your skills which match for the requirement; it will always highlight your resume and greatly improve its chances of being shortlisted.

- Many people I have noticed apply for the profile. When we call them they don’t even remember the name of the organisation for which they have applied and when we tell them about the company they say they are not interested. This behaviour is not good actually as this is a waste of time for both the parties and might reduces your chances of getting an opportunity with the company in the future.

- The Cyberguard recruitment process quite simple and straightforward. We use naukri.com and LinkedIn for hiring so you can always check there for the current openings that we have. Also drop your resume on the Email Id mentioned with the source of the post you are applying from.

- We take time to go through the profiles and shortlist them so never ask for an immediate response because technical experts also go through your resume and after that we give you a call to schedule the interview so be patient after applying for any job.

- The interview process takes time during and even after all the rounds of the interview. Always wait for the HR’s feedback and response & if you don’t get one in a week or more, do send the HR a reminder once.

Many of you may already know about the above, however at times we may slip up on some of the points, hence I have highlighted what I feel are important points to for when applying for a job, and I hope this will help you in finding a right job which in turn will help you in your career growth.
