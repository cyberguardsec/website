All the members of my family are Very Business Oriented where everyone either together or individually owns & runs their own businesses. So while growing up, I did not have the experience of seeing anyone immediately close to me doing a 9 to 5 job. However, we were always encouraged not just to fall back on the family business, but to explore avenues with the organisations outside and fortunately I got a chance to do so when I started working at Cyberguard.

When I was completing my masters & I was not aware of placement processes or the kind of work that organisations do on a daily basis. I understood this eventually from the shared experiences of my friends as well as my cousins and they have helped me throughout my journey till now, especially one cousin who is a professor in a well known institute and she has been an inspiration for me growing up. 

I always looked toward joining an MNC though I heard stories both good and bad about working in such organisations. I consider myself lucky to have joined Cyberguard which has given me opportunities to work on diverse tasks and not be boxed into or be limited by the textbook definition of what an HR does.
 
An ideal company is one which provides a healthy and good environment and opportunities for employees to learn and grow. 

Talking about our Company Culture at Cyberguard  we have a very employee friendly and a stress free working environment that I have seen first hand increasing our productivity.

All the senior Management and team members are very supportive and they are always ready to help in problem solving. The best part is employees' opinions are valued at every step. The exposure, opportunities, trust and free hand that we get helped us to build a strong career and profile.

Talking about the Employee Job Satisfaction, it’s very important that while working we are able to have personal life balance and I feel very happy to say here at Cyberguard we need not to worry about the same.

In my journey till now with Cyberguard, I have not only achieved career growth but I have also learnt to handle increasing responsibilities. Here I work as a Sr HR Executive and while working I never feel bossed around by management and other senior team members. Everyone respects each other and their work. We are always together like a family. We enjoy every moment now and then & we never miss a chance to celebrate cheerful moments. Also the best part is we have flexible working hours and holidays which means balancing your work life & personal life is very easy.

We spend a third of our prime years working, and companies must strive to make this part of their employees’ lives happy, comfortable and satisfactory which will only enable them to reciprocate with ever improving quality of work and loyalty.
