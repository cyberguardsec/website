## What is Crusoe Surf?

**Crusoe Surf** enables end-users to naturally browse the web while leaving malware, including **Zero Day** attacks, safely isolated from the internal network and end-user endpoints. 

Using Crusoe Securityâ€™s innovative **Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)** technology, Crusoe Surf eliminates the browser attack vector without hindering user productivity, effectively removing the biggest security risks from the equation.

## The Problem

> Gartner estimates that 98% of all external information security attacks happen over the public internet, and 80% of those attacks are carried out through web browsers.

- ##### Browsers are Extremely Vulnerable
  - Web browsers are feature rich and execute code written in JavaScript. This allows attackers to introduce and execute malicious code on web pages.
  - End users are vulnerable to phishing attacks especially when they unknowingly click on links that direct them to malicious web pages.

- ##### Detection and Classification are not Enough
  - Filtering web gateways, anti-virus and similar technologies detect potential attacks dependent on their reference databases being up to date.
  - New attack vectors are devised regularly and these solutions if not regularly updated, are left vulnerable.

> ##### Key Facts
> - At least 100,000 pieces of malware are introduced daily.
> - Ransomware is still a favorite attack vector. It is assumed that 1 of 10 URLs contain malicious code.
> - Almost 90% of attacks come from internet and email browsing which is still the weakest link.
> - Hackers are becoming more innovative with their Zero Day attacks and silent penetrations
> - According to Gartner, by 2023 25% of enterprises will actively begin to isolate web surfing and experience a 70% reduction in attacks.

## The Crusoe Surf Solution
Isolation as against Detection is the mantra. Crusoe Surf protects the organization by isolating the actual browsing inside short-lived disposable sandboxed containers in a remote environment in the DMZ or Cloud.

Crusoe Surf browses the web on behalf of the end-user streaming back only safe and sanitised content to the local browser while blocking any potentially harmful code.

It's advanced streaming protocol ensures that the end-users enjoys a natural and native-like browsing experience.

#### How it works
- Untrusted code from the Internet is executed and rendered remotely in Crusoe's Isolation Platform and never reaches the local endpoint.
- Rendered artifacts are converted to a safe Crusoe Surf visual stream which is efficiently transmitted to the client.
- User interactions are transmitted to the remote browser in real-time ensuring the end-user enjoys a native-like experience.
- Downloads, uploads, printing and additional end-user interactions are provided in an intuitive near-native way
- Integration with Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) systems allows scanning and sanitization of files before they reach the end-user

#### The Crusoe Advantage
- Crusoe Surf integrates with the existing web-filtering security policies of the organization allowing the IT and Security professionals to easily manage it without major changes to their existing workflows.
- Crusoe Surf Supports IE-only websites and peripherals such as smart cards using integration to 3rd party remoting solutions.
- Crusoe Surf has been designed from the ground up together with customer IT organizations resulting in an innovative, scalable and pragmatic offering.
