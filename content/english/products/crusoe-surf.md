## The Problem

- ##### Browsers are Extremely Vulnerable
  - Attackers can introduce and execute malicious code on web pages.
  - Malicious links in spear phishing attacks.

- ##### Detection and Classification are not Enough
  - Firewalls, anti-virus software etc. depend on malware and rules databases.
  - New attack vectors are devised at a large scale leaving enterprises vulnerable if databases are not kept upto date.

> ##### Key Facts
> - Gartner estimates that 98% of all external information security attacks happen over the public internet, and 80% of those attacks are carried out through web browsers.
> - At least 100,000 pieces of malware are introduced daily.
> - Ransomware is still a favorite attack vector. It is assumed that 1 of 10 URLs contain malicious code.
> - Almost 90% of attacks come from internet and email browsing which is still the weakest link.
> - Hackers are becoming more innovative with their Zero Day attacks and silent penetrations.
> - According to Gartner, by 2023 25% of enterprises will actively begin to isolate web surfing and experience a 70% reduction in attacks.
